TO-DO:

Both:
- Use offset property to show labels for all trains

Front end:
- Try to point trains in correct direction 
- Find a way to (quickly) relate train ID to train service running so info can include route
- Add filter for different train services once more data feeds are added 

Back end:
- Add node script to movement service package.json
- Clean up movement service as much as possible
- Subscribe to more data feeds from network rail once service is streamlined and can handle more points
