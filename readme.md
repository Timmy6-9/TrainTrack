TO-DO:

Front end:
- Add info about trains when icons are clicked on 
- Add vector icons that look like trains, try to point trains in correct direction 
- Find a way to (quickly) relate train ID to train service running so info can include route

Back end:
- Add node script to movement service package.json
- Transfer persistent array to movement service rather than on client side
- Clean up movement service, only send messages every heartbeat
- Subscribe to more data feeds from network rail once service is streamlined and can handle more points.
