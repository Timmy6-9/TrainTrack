# TrainTrack

This is my first vanilla full stack project, using javascript for the frontend as well as the backend with the node.js runtime. 

The objective was originally to show trains moving on a map in near real-time by utilizing the public data feeds provided by National Rail, however this eventually turned into showing the stations on a map and having the ability to select both a start and destination from the map to retrieve schedules from a database.

Routes with up to 5 changes can be retrieved and it's possible to use either a search bar or the icons on the map to select a start and destination. There is also the option to select a station and see all the direct routes (without changes).

The reasons I've stopped working on this project are because most further changes I could make would require quite a lot of time spent working on making the frontend look prettier or collating information about stations myself which would distract from the purpose of the project, which is to improve my coding abilities.

My one regret for this project is not writing it in Typescript, quite a few errors would have been much easier to trace or fix.
